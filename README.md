# Important
This version of [Playwright-reCAPTCHA](https://github.com/Xewdy444/Playwright-reCAPTCHA) is modified to support pages in which the reCAPTCHA frame is explicitly rendered, that is, it doesn't need a checkbox selection to appear on the screen. There's also support for reCAPTCHA with pt-BR locale strings.

I don't intend to contribute directly to the main repository of this package since my main intention was just to quickly fill the needs of the specified modifications for a college project.
